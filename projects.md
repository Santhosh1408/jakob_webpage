# Current Research Project

I'm currently part of the Vitality Lab at the University of Illinois Chicago, where we work on creating digital tools to help people lead healthier lives. Our focus is on supporting individuals with chronic conditions like cancer, obesity, and diabetes by improving their diet, physical activity, and weight management. We combine behavioral science with technology to develop solutions that are accessible and effective. Our goal is to make healthy living easier and more achievable for everyone.

# Graduate Projects

1. De-expression Residue Learning

Developed a method for de-expressing image samples through residue learning. Trained a U-Net generator to create high-quality de-expressed images by utilizing layer-specific residuals and a custom loss function for effective expression learning.

Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV

Architecture: Conditional GANs, U-Net, Residue Learning

2. Neural Machine Translation: French to English 

Built a French-to-English translation model using LSTM-based seq2seq and Transformer architectures. Preprocessed bilingual text with tokenization, padding, and vocabulary indexing. Trained models with teacher forcing and evaluated using BLEU scores. Enhanced fluency using attention mechanisms.

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK

Architecture: LSTM, Transformer, Encoder-Decoder, Attention

3. Progressive In-Context Alignment (PICA)

Reproduced the PICA method for in-context learning using the LLaMA2-7B model from scratch in Google Colab. Implemented Zero-shot, Vanilla ICL, and PICA setups with controlled token generation (10â€“150 tokens). Built custom prompt formats, handled dataset inputs, and evaluated outputs using embedding similarity, BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity.

Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Google Colab

Model Type: LLaMA2-7B, In-Context Learning (ICL), PICA 

Evaluation: Cosine Similarity, BLEU, ROUGE, JustEval (Helpful, Factual, Clear, Deep, Engaging, Safe)

4. Learning Based Airline Delay Estimation

Developed a predictive model to classify flight delays using large-scale flight and weather data, performing data analysis and applying deep learning algorithms by analyzing several features to improve decision-making. Handled data cleaning, missing values, and feature engineering, and identified key delay-causing factors through exploratory data analysis.

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, PySpark, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Tableau, Matplotlib
