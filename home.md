# About
Hi, I’m Santhosh! I’m currently studying for my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Illinois, Chicago. I am really interested in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I find these fields fascinating because they have the power to change how we live and work. Before my master’s, I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from SRM Institute of Science and Technology in Chennai. My education there helped me build a strong foundation in computer science and sparked my passion for technology. I started my education at Bethel Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Chennai, where I first discovered my love for computers. This interest inspired me to pursue a career in technology. Outside of my studies, I like to stay active. I enjoy going to the gym and playing sports like volleyball and badminton. I also love to drive and travel to new places. My goal is to create technology in deep learning that can improve life for everyone.

# Research Interests 
My research interests are in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision. I am excited about building intelligent systems that can understand and process different types of data, like text and images, to solve real-world problems. I enjoy exploring ways to make models learn more efficiently, make better predictions, and interact meaningfully with humans. My focus includes applying deep learning techniques to NLP tasks, such as understanding and generating language, as well as to computer vision tasks, like recognizing objects and understanding scenes. Overall, I want to create smart systems that can learn from data and provide useful solutions.
