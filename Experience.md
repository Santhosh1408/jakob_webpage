# Research Intern
_Vitality Lab_

I'm currently part of the Vitality Lab at the University of Illinois Chicago, where we develop digital tools to help people lead healthier lives. Recently, I worked on a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to create personalized recipes, and we are now in the process of deploying this model as a web application to make it accessible to everyone. Our work combines AI, behavioral science, and practical nutrition guidance to support individuals in improving their diet, managing weight, and adopting healthier lifestyle habits. The goal is to provide tools that are not only effective but also easy to use, helping people make healthier choices every day.

# Graduate Hourly
_IT Services - College of Business Administration_

I am also a part of the CBA IT Team at the University of Illinois Chicago, where we manage and support all IT services for the College of Business Administration. Our team is responsible for deploying new systems, maintaining networks, and ensuring that technology runs smoothly across the college. We handle technical issues, Wi-Fi connectivity, and a wide range of IT services to make sure faculty, staff, and students have reliable and efficient access to technology. Being part of this team allows me to contribute to the smooth functioning of the collegeâ€™s IT infrastructure while gaining hands-on experience with real world technical challenges.

# Software Development Intern
_Softlogic Systems_ 

Worked closely with senior developers on real-world software projects, contributing to full-stack application development using Java, Python, and MySQL. I was involved in designing and implementing backend logic, creating database schemas, and writing optimized queries for efficient data management. Gained hands-on experience in debugging complex code, performing API development and testing using Postman, and managing version control with Git. I also worked with Eclipse and MySQL Workbench for development and database administration. Actively participated in Agile team discussions, contributed to sprint planning, and collaborated on problem-solving for technical challenges. This experience strengthened my ability to write clean, maintainable code, adapt quickly to new technologies, and contribute effectively in a fast-paced software development environment.
